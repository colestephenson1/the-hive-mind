## Introduction
  - The goal of this project was to create a React application that showcases my personal passiona while demonstrating a concrete grasp of foundational React/Cypress skills. 
  - Visit The Hive Mind and you will see three cards displayed, each one representing a different archetype of blue decks you can play. Check out all three to expand your blue knowledge and prowess to new levels. The Hive Mind is glad to know us.
## Technologies
  - React
  - JavaScript
  - Cypress
  - Router
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Features
- When clicked, each one populates a decklist, embedded video of a pro playing the decklist, and a shoprt description about the archetype and what makes it strong.
-  There are also two nav bar buttons, labeled 'Guides' and 'The Goods'. Guides takes you to a repository of links that populate a new tab. The links are articles/resources if you would like extra external information about MTG blue. 
- The Goods brings up a repository of blue cards that can be filtered by card type.

## Possible Future Extensions
- A way to make custom decklists through a favoriting function.
- A way to keep track of competitive blue decks that place in the top eight of high-ranking events.
